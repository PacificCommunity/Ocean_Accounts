The zip files include either the year 2015 only or the full time serie with one image per year from 1992 to 2015. The quality flags are common to all years.

Remark: the "b" in v2.0.7b is linked to the netcdf format and does not involve any change in data.

Remark 2: the huge difference in size between tif/netcdf is due to efficient tif compression through bands. The same data is present in both files.
